Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my Github page!

I'm Romina, a Junior Game Quality Analyst 🎮 with a passion for gaming and all things tech-related 🤖. Currently, I'm studying the VR/AR Specialization 🌟 at Holberton School in Montevideo 🇺🇾.

I have experience in game testing, content creation, social media management, and customer service 🤝. I'm a problem-solver with strong analytical skills and familiarity with various programming languages including C, Python, and JavaScript.

I'm excited to keep learning and growing in the tech industry, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills 🌱. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing games, watching movies 🍿, singing (all the time), or hanging out with my friends and family.

Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch! Let's collaborate and create something amazing together! 🤝

🚀 Thanks for stopping by! 😄
